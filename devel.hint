sdesc: "Discrete Fourier transform library (development)"
ldesc: "FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete 
Fourier transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input 
size, and of both real and complex data (as well as of even/odd data, 
i.e. the discrete cosine/sine transforms or DCT/DST)."
